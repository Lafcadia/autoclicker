# Python auto clicker
A simple auto clicker application made with tkinter/pyautogui

## Modes
- Single Click: Clicks at a given location, kind of useless
- Set amount of clicks: Clicks as many times as you want at a specific location
- Spam click everywhere: Spam clicks as fast as it can wherever your mouse is

## Failsafe
Stopping the spam clicking can be hard, so I want to remind people that moving the mouse to the top left of your screen will stop pyautogui.
